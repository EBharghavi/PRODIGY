# **Problem Statement:**
The real estate industry faces challenges in accurately predicting the sales prices of residential properties, impacting the ability of homebuyers and sellers to make well-informed decisions. To address this issue, a predictive modeling task has been defined wherein the goal is to forecast the sales price for each house in the test set. The evaluation metric for this task is the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), calculated between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. This approach is chosen to ensure that errors in predicting both expensive and inexpensive houses contribute equally to the evaluation, providing a fair assessment of the model's performance across the entire price spectrum.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates the sales prices of houses. The specific goals and objectives are as follows:

1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Develop a model that can predict the sales prices of houses with a high degree of accuracy. The use of RMSE ensures that the model is effective across a range of house prices, minimizing the impact of errors in predictions for both high-value and low-value properties.

2. **Logarithmic Transformation:** Implement a logarithmic transformation on both the predicted and observed sales prices. This transformation ensures that the model's performance is evaluated in a manner where errors in predicting prices at different ends of the spectrum are treated equally, enhancing the fairness of the evaluation process.

3. **Generalization:** Train the predictive model on a diverse dataset and validate its performance on a test set. The goal is to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data, providing reliable predictions for a variety of houses with different features and price points.

4. **Model Robustness:** Build a model that is robust to variations in the real estate market, including fluctuations in housing prices and changes in demand. The goal is to create a model that maintains its accuracy and reliability over time.

5. **Interpretability:** Develop a model that allows for interpretation of results, enabling stakeholders to understand the factors influencing the predicted sales prices. This transparency is essential for building trust in the model's predictions.

6. **Submission Requirement:** Generate predictions for each house in the test set and submit the results in a format that includes the predicted values for the SalePrice variable. The submission will be evaluated based on the RMSE metric, reflecting the accuracy of the model's predictions compared to the actual sales prices.
